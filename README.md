# Desktop-Cleaner-Project

This repository will be used to store various files I will create for a desktop icon cleaner. 

The general idea is for a gui based program that lets you sort you desktop icons into various categories, 
whether thats .exe's, text documents, project files, ext... Once in these groups, you can organize them on your desktop as a group,
that is already sorted by name, icon color, (or more if i get to it). The program will act as a temporary save state for you to fiddle
with to figure out where you want the icons to go. Once satisfied with how it looks, you can save it and it will modify your actual desktop
to what you had created.
